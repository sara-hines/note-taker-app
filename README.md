[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

If you've ever needed a platform to create and store notes, whether for personal organization, for your small business, household management, or another pursuit, this note-taker app is designed to meet that need. By navigating to the application in the browser, the user can create and save notes as JSON data using an attractive and intuitive user interface. One a note has been created, its title will show in the sidebar on the left, which can be clicked to display the note once again. A note can also be deleted by clicking the delete icon to the right of the note title in the sidebar. The app stays updated with the additions and deletions you have made, so that you're able to view and manage your notes with ease and accuracy. The app has an integrated frontend and backend, so the user is able to make GET, POST, and DELETE requests via their interaction with DOM elements rather than needing to rely on local storage in the browser or having to make manual calls to an API. (Although, users interested in Express.js, APIs, and HTTP request methods can make requests to various endpoints in platforms like Insomnia, if desired.) Feel free to read through the Installation, Usage, and Features sections to learn more about the app and how to get started!

To create a note, the user will enter the note title in the input element with the placeholder text "Note Title" and enter the content of the note in the textarea element with the placeholder text "Note Text". A "Clear Form" button will appear once any text has been added to either element, and a "Save Note" button will appear once text has been added to both elements. If the user decides they would like to discard the note, they can click the "Clear Form" button to do so. Once the title and note text have been fully entered, the user can click the "Save Note" button to save the note. The below screenshot shows a sample note a small business owner might create.

## Credits

I had a great meeting with Joem Casusi early on in this project. Joem helped me to better understand how to organize my file structure in apps with an increasingly delineated (but integrated) frontend and backend services. He also helped me troubleshoot some initial issues with 400 status codes. I appreciate Joem's assistance and insight.
